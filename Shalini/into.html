<h2>Adding Technology to the menu<hr></h2>
<p class="para">If you have trouble deciding what to have for dinner, help could soon be at hand â€“ with your food texting to tell you it needs eating.

The chips could also potentially alert the owner by sending them a text message telling them they need to eat the food.The new technology could be far more effective than traditional sell-by dates which do not account for the conditions it is being stored in.It could also radically reduce the amount of food which is thrown away.
